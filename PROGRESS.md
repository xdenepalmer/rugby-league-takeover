# PROGRESS — Rugby League Takeover

_Last updated: 2026-06-02 (RLT-001F)_

## Current source of truth
- **Integration branch (current):** `bmad/baseline-integration` — clean, validated baseline.
- **Backup preserve branch:** `bmad/baseline-preserve-current-state` (validated pre-BMAD state @ `14d17a1`) — do not delete.
- **Store-shipping WIP branch:** `bmad/wip-store-shipping` (`f0684600`) — concurrent checkout/shipping work, isolated by RLT-001F; resume via RLT-011 only if the Architect chooses.
- **Baseline commit:** RLT-001D docs @ `f6d1271` (RLT-001F adds a docs commit on top).
- Canonical base for logic/backend remains `origin/main`.

## Core rules
- **Backend authority:** Base44 functions/entities are authoritative. The frontend is **projection only** — never trust client state for security or data integrity.
- **Manual Base44 Publish required:** merged code is not live until the app is published in Base44. GitHub sync alone does not publish to users.
- **Antigravity** is the dedicated UI/UX engineer and must use the **`ui-ux-pro-max`** skill (https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/tree/main) for UI/UX work.

## Validation status (clean baseline, RLT-001F @ `f6d1271`)
- `npm test` — ✅ pass (33/33)
- `npm run lint` — ✅ pass
- `npm run typecheck` — ✅ pass
- `npm run build` — ✅ pass
- Note: the prior `npm test` 43/44 (1 fail, "Stripe checkout … shipping") was caused by the concurrent store-shipping WIP polluting the working tree. RLT-001F isolated that WIP onto `bmad/wip-store-shipping`; the clean baseline passes 33/33.

## Status milestones
- RLT-001D — BMAD control-plane files + project identity — **Architect-approved**.
- RLT-001F — concurrent store-shipping WIP isolated; baseline restored clean — **completed**.

## Current priorities (recommended next)
1. RLT-001E — mobile/PWA/brand/store hardening (deferred preserved tests + source).
2. RLT-001C — decide forum publish/moderation policy.
3. RLT-011 — store shipping checkout completion (only if Architect resumes `bmad/wip-store-shipping`).

## Known deferred items
- **RLT-001C** — forum publish policy (moderate-before-publish vs auto-publish; `submitForumPost.is_published`).
- **RLT-001E** — mobile/PWA/brand/store hardening: `min-h-dvh` across 8 shells, local PWA icons in `index.html`/`manifest` + icon assets, remote-logo delocalization, `Store.jsx` inline checkout-error UX. (Tests authored on the preserve branch, deferred from RLT-001B for scope.)
- **RLT-004** — StoreOrder creation authority hardening (server-authoritative).
- **RLT-006** — checkout oversell/reservation strategy.

## Notes
- Concurrent implementation work (Codex) may appear in the working tree (e.g. store-shipping). Each agent commits only its own bounded story's files.
- No push / no PR without explicit Architect instruction.
