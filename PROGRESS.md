# PROGRESS — Rugby League Takeover

_Last updated: 2026-06-03 (RLT-001C-1b)_

> **Forum policy = Option D** (auto-publish + safety). RLT-001C-1 (truthful compose copy) merged → `main` `876de8c`. ⚠️ A Base44 auto-sync commit (`29080c8`) then re-added the remote logo to `index.html`, breaking `app-shell-metadata` + `local-brand-assets` (main 40/42). **RLT-001C-1b** (this branch, off `876de8c`) restores `/icons/icon-192.png` → tests back to **42/42**; awaiting merge. **Manual Base44 Publish blocked until RLT-001C-1b merges + main is green.** Next: RLT-001C-2 (report/flag + auto-hide + rate-limit, backend).

> **`main` lint gate RESTORED** via **RLT-001W** (squash-merged → `main` `258c642`). `origin/main` has since advanced to `8fafdaf` ("UX polish pass 3", still lint-green).
> - **RLT-001X** (`bmad/story-rlt-001x-engagement-clamp`, worktree from current `origin/main` `8fafdaf`): forum `getEngagement` likes/views clamped `Math.max(0,…)` + 5 tests. **tests 42/42, `npm run lint` green, typecheck/build green.** Awaiting push/PR + merge. **Replaces RLT-001S cleanly.**
> - **RLT-001W** — MERGED (`258c642`). **RLT-001V** blocked/superseded. **RLT-001P/Q/R/S/T/U** superseded.
> - Manual Base44 Publish still required to take merged work live.
> - ⚠️ Base44 auto-sync keeps moving `main` — source stories use fixed-SHA worktrees + PRs; merge promptly (trial-merge before merging if base moved).

## Current source of truth
- **Reconciliation branch (current, recommended for next PR):** `bmad/reconcile-rlt-001k` — branched from canonical `origin/main` (`8c3dd79`, which already carries the live Antigravity UI/UX pass); approved RLT-001E baseline deltas replayed onto it (15 files clean-applied + 6 hand-merged keeping both Antigravity and RLT-001E). Validation 37/37 green. Fast-forwardable descendant of `origin/main` → a fresh PR from it will be conflict-free. Manual Base44 Publish required after merge.
- **PR #1 (`bmad/baseline-integration` → `main`):** **superseded** by `bmad/reconcile-rlt-001k`, GitHub-CONFLICTING. Remains **open** until a replacement PR is created, then close referencing the new PR. Do not merge PR #1.
- **Integration branch (prior):** `bmad/baseline-integration` @ RLT-001E merge (`4aa991f`) — RLT-001E + FIXUP merged in (`--no-ff`, no conflicts); validation 37/37 green.
- **Backup preserve branch:** `bmad/baseline-preserve-current-state` (validated pre-BMAD state @ `14d17a1`) — do not delete.
- **Store-shipping WIP branch:** `bmad/wip-store-shipping` (`f0684600`) — concurrent checkout/shipping work, isolated by RLT-001F; resume via RLT-011 only if the Architect chooses.
- **Codex store-shipping story WIP branch:** `bmad/story-rlt-011-codex-store-shipping` (`46d069b`) — current dirty WIP preserved by RLT-001H; `.gitignore` included for preservation only and is not approved for baseline.
- **Antigravity UI/UX WIP branch:** `bmad/wip-antigravity-uiux` (`65d417f`) — unapproved UI/UX pass (18 files), isolated by RLT-001G; must come back through `ui-ux-pro-max` + an approved BMAD story.
- **Local main repaired:** local `main` reset to `origin/main` (`8c3dd79`) during RLT-001H. No push performed.
- Canonical base for logic/backend remains `origin/main`; baseline branch remains the approved integration line.

## Core rules
- **Backend authority:** Base44 functions/entities are authoritative. The frontend is **projection only** — never trust client state for security or data integrity.
- **Manual Base44 Publish required:** merged code is not live until the app is published in Base44. GitHub sync alone does not publish to users.
- **Antigravity** is the dedicated UI/UX engineer and must use the **`ui-ux-pro-max`** skill (https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/tree/main) for UI/UX work.
- **No direct shared-branch work:** no agent may work directly on `main` or `bmad/baseline-integration` without an Architect-approved BMAD story.

## Validation status (clean baseline, RLT-001F @ `f6d1271`)
- `npm test` — ✅ pass (33/33)
- `npm run lint` — ✅ pass
- `npm run typecheck` — ✅ pass
- `npm run build` — ✅ pass
- Note: the prior `npm test` 43/44 (1 fail, "Stripe checkout … shipping") was caused by the concurrent store-shipping WIP polluting the working tree. RLT-001F isolated that WIP onto `bmad/wip-store-shipping`; the clean baseline passes 33/33.

## Status milestones
- RLT-001D — BMAD control-plane files + project identity — **Architect-approved**.
- RLT-001F — concurrent store-shipping WIP isolated; baseline restored clean — **Architect-approved**.
- RLT-001G — Antigravity UI/UX WIP isolated; baseline restored clean — **completed**.
- RLT-001H — active Codex store-shipping WIP preserved; branch discipline restored — **completed**. No feature implementation completed.
- RLT-001E (+ FIXUP) — mobile/PWA/brand/store hardening — **merged into `bmad/baseline-integration`** (RLT-001E-MERGE, `--no-ff`, no conflicts). Antigravity final UX pass P0 12/12. Manual Base44 Publish required to go live.
- RLT-001I — pushed baseline + opened **PR #1**; GitHub flagged CONFLICTING (baseline ↔ `origin/main` divergence) — **completed** (not merged).
- RLT-001J — read-only conflict analysis; found `origin/main` already carries the live Antigravity UI/UX pass; recommended Option B — **completed**.
- RLT-001K — reconciled approved RLT-001E baseline onto canonical `origin/main` on `bmad/reconcile-rlt-001k` (15 clean-applied + 6 hand-merged, keeping both Antigravity and RLT-001E); 37/37 validation green — **completed**. Manual Base44 Publish required after final merge.

## RLT-001E summary (story branch `bmad/story-rlt-001e-claude`, off `dacd266`)
- `min-h-dvh` across 8 shells + HeroSection double-viewport fix; local PWA icons (`/icons/*`) in manifest (maskable + shortcut icons) and index.html; OG/Twitter/description metadata; remote Base44 logo delocalized (HeroSection, SiteNav, SiteSettingsManager, index.html, manifest); Store checkout info-style preview notice (no `alert`), `inputMode=email`, Stripe secure-checkout trust signal; skip-to-content link. 5 deferred tests now green. Validation 37/37. No backend/entity/function changes.
- **RLT-001E-FIXUP** (Antigravity conditional-pass items): Account/Store bottom padding now safe-area aware (`pb-[calc(7rem+var(--safe-bottom))]` / `pb-[calc(5rem+var(--safe-bottom))]`); `#root` gets `100dvh` with `100vh` fallback; AuthLayout form panel `overflow-y-auto` + `max-h-dvh` so tall forms don't clip. Validation 37/37 green.

## Current priorities (recommended next)
1. Review + merge `bmad/story-rlt-001e-claude` into `bmad/baseline-integration`.
2. RLT-001C — decide forum publish/moderation policy.
3. RLT-011 — store shipping checkout completion (only if Architect resumes `bmad/wip-store-shipping`).

## Process reminder
- **Antigravity** must work through **`ui-ux-pro-max`** specifications and an **approved BMAD story** before any UI implementation change is committed to baseline. Unapproved UI/UX passes will be isolated to a WIP branch (see RLT-001G).
- Concurrent agents should commit to their own branches, not the shared baseline working tree.
- `.gitignore` local tooling ignores were preserved only on the WIP branch; landing them on baseline requires a future control-plane story.

## Known deferred items
- **RLT-001C** — forum publish policy (moderate-before-publish vs auto-publish; `submitForumPost.is_published`).
- **RLT-001E** — mobile/PWA/brand/store hardening: `min-h-dvh` across 8 shells, local PWA icons in `index.html`/`manifest` + icon assets, remote-logo delocalization, `Store.jsx` inline checkout-error UX. (Tests authored on the preserve branch, deferred from RLT-001B for scope.)
- **RLT-004** — StoreOrder creation authority hardening (server-authoritative).
- **RLT-006** — checkout oversell/reservation strategy.

## Notes
- Concurrent implementation work (Codex) may appear in the working tree (e.g. store-shipping). Each agent commits only its own bounded story's files.
- No push / no PR without explicit Architect instruction.
